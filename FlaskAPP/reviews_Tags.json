The staff was polite and the food was great. \\nAfter a few visits the service and the quality of the restaurant has plummeted significantly.  Today's visit the waitress handed paper copied menus and served drinks in plastic cups. There was grace period where we were allowed to view the xerox copied menus and upon coming to a decision the waitress waited until I was ready to order to advise they had run out of fries...FRIES! (Who serves wings without fries). It was decided that today was not the day to consume food at the restaurant. When the waitress was advised the choice was made not to stay at the establishment a bill was brought over for the one sweet tea I consumed...unbelievable!\r\nThe drink wasn't even compensated for being inconvenienced.

I walked in here around 12 noon today and it was packed mostly with Swarthmore College students with books and laptops open studying.   It was pretty loud and pretty dirty as if the floor hadn't been swept or mopped in a while. Nonetheless I walked up to the counter and waited for the other college students behind the counter finish their not work related conversation rather than wait on an old head like me.   Finally the young lady behind the counter asked me if I had ordered yet and I said, \\\"No. I just want to cup of coffee.\\\" She asked me to step aside to where she put it in the computer and I waited there for my cup of coffee only to have a step back 30 seconds later to where I was originally standing (and nobody else was) where she pointed to where to pick it up.   She  couldn't even bother to hand it to me  or place it on the counter in front of me.   I was essentially invisible to the folks behind the counter so as far as I'm concerned I can spend my money elsewhere.",

Well, one would be wrong because this place is awesome! I've been here for lunch twice and both experiences were delightful.\\nWe had the same waiter both times and he's super cool and attentive. He makes great recommendations every time and he's always on point. \\nThe last time I went my dining companion and I shared the fried mozzarella. Seems like a safe, uninspired choice. However, their take on this staple is delightful! They use balls of fresh mozzarella and douse it in their marinara which is absolutely delicious. Hands down the best take on fried mozzarella I've ever tasted. \\nTheir menu is quite expansive and has both pasta and meat dishes, but I have gone the pasta route both times. Most recently I ordered the special which was fusilli in a bolognese sauce and it was delicious. On top of the pasta they put a dollop of fresh ricotta which really added to the dish. The portions were substantial too so we both had enough for lunch the next day. \\nDesserts aren't made on premise, but who cares because they were delicious. I got my fave, tiramisu, both times and it's wonderful. Especially when paired with their cappuccino. \\nI love this restaurant and definitely recommend it, especially after a long day of shopping at Peddler's Village.",
